### Overview

This project applies an Autoencoder-based approach to dimensionality reduction and clustering in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It compares a series of UMAP outputs from various dimensionality reduction techniques including PCA and a nueral network autoencoder generated by PyTorch.

### Features

- Preprocess scRNA-seq data using Scanpy
- Dimensionality reduction with Autoencoder vs. PCA
- Leiden clustering on Autoencoder-based embeddings
- UMAP visualization to compare PCA vs. Autoencoder
- Biological interpretation using marker genes
